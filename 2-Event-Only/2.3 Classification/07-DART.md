# DART: Distribution aware retinal transform for event-based cameras

T-PAMI 2019

## Research Question / Motivation:
    How to describe a feature point in event stream? 


## Contribution:
(1) An event-based structural descriptor using
a log-polar grid, termed as distribution aware retinal transform (DART).

(2) The DART descriptor is validated on four downstream tasks, namely object classification, tracking, detection and feature matching.  

## Highlight:
(1) The log-polar grid is centered at the latest event and the past events, which simulates the distribution of cones in the primate fovea.

(2) It's robust to scale, rotation, and viewpoint variations.

## Weakness:
