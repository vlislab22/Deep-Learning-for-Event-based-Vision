# Learning from Images: A Distillation Learning Framework for Event Cameras

T-IP 2021

## Research Question:
    How to extract discriminative representations using event-based model?   

## Motivation:
(1) Traditional images and event signals share considerable visual information, which can be used to guid representation extracing.

(2) The process of event-based representation extracting is ineffective, given that event data contain almost all visual information to perform the vision tasks.

## Contribution:
(1) A distillation framework that use discriminative image feature to provide extra supervision of feature extraction of the event data. 

(2) A new event classification dataset, CEP-DVS, captured under random motion conditions.

## Highlight:
(1) First one to improve the representation ability of event data from the feature distillation view.

(2) Specific customizations for different feature distillation stages.
