# Graph-Based Object Classification for Neuromorphic Vision Sensing / Graph-Based Spatio-temporal Feature Learning for Neuromorphic Vision Sensing

ICCV 2019 / T-IP 2020

## Research Question:
	How to conduct object classification using graph CNNs?
	
## Motivation:
(1) Event data mismatches the process of CNNs.  
(2) Graph CNNs are computationally efficient.
(3) Conventional event dataset sources from monitor recordings can't capture the real dynamics of the event camera.


## Contribution:
(1) A graph-based representation for events classification, allowing for fast end-to-end task training and inference.

(2) Residual graph CNNs(RG-CNNs) for event-based object classification.

(3)  A real-world event dataset ASL-DVS, with large amount of labelled examples.  

## Highlight:
(1) First work to represent event data as a graph.  

(2) The computation of the proposed graph network is one-fifth of that of ResNet50, while with SOTA performance.
