# Learning to Reconstruct HDR Images from Events, with Applications to Depth and Flow Prediction

IJCV, 2021

##  Research Questions
The research question is how to reconstruct images or videos from events stream. Because event cameras can transfer all the information needed to reconstruct an image or a full video stream. 

##  Motivation
(1)	Events naturally include more gradient information and vary spatially within an image or temporally among the sequence of images.
(2)	Motion blur and sharpness are not highly critical features in optical flow or depth estimation.
(3)	Why SBNï¼š
a)	When the event data within the time interval are not enough for the image reconstruction, it is inevitably difficult to obtain good HDR images. 

##  Challenges
(1)	Since evens and frame-based images are quite different, how to feed events as input to a deep neural network remains a challenge.
