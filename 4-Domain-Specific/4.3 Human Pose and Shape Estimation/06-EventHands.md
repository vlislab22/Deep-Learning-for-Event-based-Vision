# EventHands: Real-Time Neural 3D Hand Pose Estimation from an Event Stream

ICCV2021
    
## Research Question:
	How to estimate 3D hand pose from a single event camera, i.e., an asynchronous vision sensor reacting on brightness changes.

## Motivation:
  The high dynamic range, lower latency, and lower throughput of event data are better suited than conventional images for tracking hands, which are often in rapid motion.

## HighLight:
  EventHands is a learning-based appraoch and the first method for 3D reconstruction of a human hand from a single event stream.

## Contributions:
(1) EventHands, i.e., the first approach for 3D hand pose estimation, including rotation and translation in 3D, from a single event stream, running at 1 KHz;

(2) A new high-throughput event stream simulator supporting a parametric 3D hand model for diverse poses, shapes and textures, multiple light sources, adjustable evnet stream properties and furthre scene augmentation.
