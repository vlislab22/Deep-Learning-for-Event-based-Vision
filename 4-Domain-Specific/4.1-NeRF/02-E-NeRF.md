# E-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from a Moving Event Camera

Arxiv 2022

## Research Question:
          Recover NeRFs during very fast motion and in high dynamic range conditions, where frame-based approaches fail.

## Highlights:
(1) 
  
## Motivation:
(1) The event camera is a type of camera which addresses both these shortcomings of real-world conventional cameras, high-dynamic range (HDR) and fast motion.
## Contributions:
(1) E-NeRF: The first attempt to tackle NeRF estimation from event cameras during very fast motion. (claimed)
(2) E-NeRF combines event stream with color images.
