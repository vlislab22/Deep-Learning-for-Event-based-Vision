# Speed Invariant Time Surface for Learning to Detect Corner Points with Event-Based Cameras

CVPR 2019

## Research Question:
	How to conduct corner detection suitable for event-based data?

## Motivation:
(1) Simple extensions of corner detection methods designed for standard intensity images do not perform well on event-based data.  
(2) Hand-crafted detectors remain unstable and corners can not be reliably detected over time.


## Contribution:
(1) An efficient way to compute a time surface that is invariant to the speed of the objects.

(2) A high-resolution dataset suitable for quantitative evaluation and comparison of corner detection methods for event-based cameras.


## Highlight:
(1) It's robust to abrupt changes of direction of the corners.  

(2) It's available to assign a confidence score for the corners, which can be useful for postprocessing.
